# Temperature-converter
A temperature converter built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to input a temperature value in one unit (e.g., Celsius) and instantly see its equivalent in other units (e.g., Fahrenheit, Kelvin). CSS styles enhance the appearance, while JavaScript handles the conversion logic, making temperature conversion seamless and interactive
